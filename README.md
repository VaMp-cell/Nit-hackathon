        # CityPulse (Mock) - Ready to run

This project is a complete mock/demo of the CityPulse app and runs on Flutter **web** without any Firebase or native setup.

## How to run
1. Install Flutter and ensure `flutter` is on your PATH.
2. Unzip the project folder and open it in VS Code or Android Studio.
3. From terminal run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

The app uses an in-memory mock backend (no network, no Firebase).

## If you want Firebase instead
- I can convert the mock service calls to Firebase and provide instructions; you'll need to add your Firebase config files.
